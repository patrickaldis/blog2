> You are about to begin reading the latest post on `phishing for compliments`, titled *If on a winter's night a traveller*. Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.

This book is written like no other book I've read. Calvino writes almost entirely in second person, putting thoughts and concepts in your head and giving a commentary as you read about you reading. Whats awesome is this weird perspective allows him to say things about the process - he can create a story about you reading; from how the words on the page slowly give you more information about the surroundings; to how the author has been intentionally vague, leaving your mind to fill in the gaps. You're then taken on a weird dive into books within books, all the while forgetting that you're reading about you reading them. The lines between reader and read begin to blur and it tells a great story.

# Ideas
Not only did calvino manage to say something about the nature of reading and writing, he also manages to create various situations and characters that tickle my brain the right way.

## Marana
The part-antagonist of the book spends his time travelling to countries to use their books as fuel for counterfeiting. New books in Athens? Go to Athens, take the new book, swap the character names with those of Crime and Punishment and the new Greek translation of Crime and Punishment is ready to sell.

## Organisation of Apocyrphal Power
In the latter half of the book, a cult surrounds the author Silas Flannery. These cultists are mad about the purity of written books and see the author as a religious icon; the author’s books are so far from his own that he’s seen as a god. Flannery has a crack team of ghost writers working round the clock to finish his half-written books. The cult gets wind that Flannery is in a crisis over his work (or lack of) and this splits the relgious sect down the middle. Two factions emerge. One, who believe that Flannery will, in his quest for authentic pure storytelling, produce a book of immense purity never before seen. And the other, who believe that he will fully commit to the bit and out of his crisis will produce a text that is such a falsity, it will serve to be a masterpiece in it's own right.

Apparently there is genshin lore based off this, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/?f=flair_name%3A%22Traveler%20%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F%22)

## Notable Mentions
I love the idea that there's a wise indian dude out there who utters every story ever. Flannery's story about the two writers also slaps. 

# Warning
As my first blog post I'm still finding out what I want to say. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to do a more detailed analysis or whether this would be too boring to write. I settled on just writing about the points I would talk about with others. I also read the English translation by Brace Jovanovich. This could have been an entirely different book.
