I didn't want to anger the narrator so I did exactly this.
In reflection this was the perfect introduction to the book -
* The Incipit
* The Ideas
    * The translator
    * The twin writers
* Why do we read
* The blurring of layers of storytelling
    * Feel more involved as a you
    * Reading is more personal than writing
    * The distinct layers are broken down
* A classic has to be reread
* There's genshin lore? here

* Organisation of Apocyrphal Power: In the latter half of the book, a cult surrounds the author Silas Flannery. These cultists are mad about the purity of written books and see the author as a religious icon; the author’s books are so far from his own that he’s seen as some god.

And the other, who believe that Flannery will fully commit to the bit and out of his crisis he will produce a text that is so plagarised, it will serve to be an example of immense 
* The Twin Writers: Out in a small remote town two writers write. One writer is very prolific, writes exactly what is on his mind
* Father of Stories: There is a dude out there

Is the book logically consistent?
