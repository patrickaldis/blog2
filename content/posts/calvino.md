> You're about to begin reading `name`'s new post, *if on a winter's night a traveller*. Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.

I didn't want to anger the narrator so I did exactly this. 

In reflection this was the perfect introduction to the book - 

- The Incipit
- The Ideas
  - The translator
  - The twin writers
- Why do we read
- The blurring of layers of storytelling
  - Feel more involved as a you
  - Reading is more personal than writing
  - The distinct layers are broken down
- A classic has to be reread
- There's genshin lore? [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/11y7kme/if_on_a_winters_night_a_traveler/)

- **Marana**: Spends his time travelling from 
- **Organisation of Apocyrphal Power**:
- **The Twin Writers**:
- **Father of Stories**:
